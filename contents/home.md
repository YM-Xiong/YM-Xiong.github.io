☆ During my master's degree studies, I engaged in research concerning the distribution of residual stress within steel structures under the influence of thermal processes. My focus encompassed exploring the intricate relationship between residual stress and fatigue mechanisms. During this period, I also dedicated significant effort to the related study of fatigue crack repair using CFPR and epoxy adhesive.
☆ Throughout my doctoral studies, I embarked on a systematic examination of aligned steel fiber UHPC materials and their associated structural fabrications. The proposed research ideals gained approval from my supervisor and led to independent formulation of research proposals, successful fund acquisition, and autonomous execution of comprehensive research investigations.
☆ My technical proficiency extends to programming languages like Python and Fortran, along with adept usage of specialized software such as ABAQUS (with a focus on secondary development) and COMSOL for simulation and analysis purposes. Practical experience includes conducting various load tests and calculations within the domain of urban bridges and cable system bridges. In addition, I actively participated in the assembly and calibration of extensive intelligent production workshops, and I possess a solid command of modeling tools like SolidWorks and Creo.
